# Project Proposal

National Park GUI 

I am planning on making a national park gui which basically has the US map as the interface and you can click on any state to enlarge it and look at the parks/events in within that state. I plan on using the national park api to get all of the events and parks from the states and their locations. Furthermore I am going to use the openframeworks as a GUI template and interactions with the gui. Depending on how much progress I make, I plan on adding in features such as paths between events, paths between parks and shortest distances, and a trip creator/navigator.
